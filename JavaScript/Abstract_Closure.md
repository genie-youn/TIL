## ECMAScript Specification Type
Specification Type 은 알고리즘 내에서 ECMAScript 언어의 구문과 타입에 대한 의미를 설명하기 위한 메타값에 해당한다.

이 Specification Type 에는 [Reference](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-reference-specification-type), [List](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-list-and-record-specification-type), [Completion](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-completion-record-specification-type), [Property Descriptor](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-property-descriptor-specification-type), [Environment Record](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-environment-records), [Abstract Closure](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-abstract-closure), [Data Block](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-data-blocks) 이 포함된다.

Specification type values are specification artefacts that do not necessarily correspond to any specific entity within an ECMAScript implementation.

 Specification type values may be used to describe intermediate results of ECMAScript expression evaluation but such values cannot be stored as properties of objects or values of ECMAScript language variables.



A specification type corresponds to meta-values that are used within algorithms to describe the semantics of ECMAScript language constructs and ECMAScript language types. The specification types include Reference, List, Completion, Property Descriptor, Environment Record, Abstract Closure, and Data Block. Specification type values are specification artefacts that do not necessarily correspond to any specific entity within an ECMAScript implementation. Specification type values may be used to describe intermediate results of ECMAScript expression evaluation but such values cannot be stored as properties of objects or values of ECMAScript language variables.
